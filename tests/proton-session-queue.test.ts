/**
 * That Proton Pass sessions really are serialized, driven through the provider.
 *
 * pass-cli keeps one session per user, so two logins contend even though each
 * call gets a private session directory. The editor probes the provider while a
 * deploy resolves its secrets, and a second login that waits out its own timeout
 * fails the deploy. The queue lives in withSession, which no unit can reach
 * directly - so this drives the real provider against a stand-in binary.
