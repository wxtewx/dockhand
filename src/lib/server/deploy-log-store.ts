 * F5 fix: the directory name (under deploy-logs/) that holds ONE environment's OWN
 * run log files and counts against ONE environment's OWN size budget.
 *
 * Before this existed, every environment shared a SINGLE deploy-logs/ directory and a
 * single BUDGET_BYTES total (see SizeBudgetTracker below). A user with deploy rights
 * in ONE environment could fill that shared budget with a noisy deploy, which then
 * silently truncated the deploy logs and summaries of every OTHER environment -- a
 * multi-tenant audit-trail integrity violation, since a deploy log is exactly the
 * evidence an operator reaches for after something goes wrong. Scoping the directory
 * (and therefore the budget, since usedBytes()/usedBytesExcluding() only ever look
 * inside ONE environment's directory) per environment is the entire fix.
 *
 * `environmentId` always comes from a database column (`number | null`, see
 * ScheduleExecutionData in db.ts) -- never attacker-controlled free text reaching
 * this function directly. This still asserts the shape rather than trusting it
 * blindly, the same posture runLogFileName's ID regex takes for runId: a value that
 * is not a plain integer or null is a bug, and should throw rather than quietly
 * resolve to some unexpected directory name.
 *
 * The `null` case (an install with no environments / a run not attributed to one --
 * see createRunRecorder's `envId: number | null` input) gets the literal directory
 * name "null", not an omitted segment. `String(null) === 'null'` in JS already reads
 * exactly this way, so this is not inventing a new convention -- it is naming the one
 * `String(envId)` would already produce, so the special case is documented rather
 * than accidental.

 * Tracks whether ONE run's output has pushed ITS OWN ENVIRONMENT's deploy-logs/<env>/
 * over BUDGET_BYTES, without doing a full directory scan (readdir + stat every file)
 * on every appended line.
 *
 * Before the scan-avoidance existed, deploy-run-record.ts's line() called
 * budgetExceeded() -- a full usedBytes() scan -- after EVERY line, so a deploy with N
 * output lines against a log directory holding M past runs' files cost O(N*M) stat
 * calls. Measured on this machine: 200 lines against 500 existing log files took
 * ~16.2s (~81ms/line); the same 200 lines with the directory scan removed entirely
 * took ~49ms total. That scan is needed to stay honest about the directory's actual
 * size, so it can't just be dropped -- it can only be done less often.
 *
 * How: the directory total EXCLUDING this run's own file (usedBytesExcluding) is
 * measured once, lazily, on the first recordAppend() call, and cached. Each
 * recordAppend() after that just adds the byte length the caller reports (bytes it
 * just wrote to ITS OWN file -- no stat() involved) to that cached total in memory.
 * The cache is re-measured every REFRESH_AFTER_OWN_BYTES bytes of this run's own
 * output, so a long deploy's view of "everything else" can't drift arbitrarily far
 * from reality -- at most REFRESH_AFTER_OWN_BYTES stale before the next refresh
 * catches up.
 *
 * F5 fix, ENVIRONMENT scoping: `envId` is threaded into the constructor and passed to
 * every measureOthers() call, so "everything else" means everything else IN THIS
 * RUN'S OWN ENVIRONMENT's directory -- never another environment's files. Before this,
 * `envId` did not exist here at all: every tracker (regardless of which environment
 * its run belonged to) measured the SAME shared deploy-logs/ directory against the
 * SAME BUDGET_BYTES total, so a noisy deploy in one environment could push every other
 * environment's tracker over budget too, truncating runs that never wrote anywhere
 * near BUDGET_BYTES themselves. See deploy-run-record.ts's module doc comment (F5
 * fix) and DeployRunRecorder's envId field for how this is wired end to end.
 *
 * Concurrency: OTHER runs in the SAME environment writing at the same time are
 * invisible between this tracker's refreshes. A second run in the same environment
 * that starts writing right after this one's baseline was measured can add up to its
 * own full output before the next refresh reflects it, so the total this tracker
 * checks against can undercount the real directory size by that much in the
 * meantime. This is an intentional trade-off: BUDGET_BYTES (2 GiB, deliberately
 * generous) exists to catch a filled disk, not to enforce an exact quota -- the
 * design doc calls for aborting "at the end of writing, not truncating mid-line",
 * never for a precise cutoff. The OLD per-line full rescan did not close this gap
 * either: budgetExceeded() reads the directory at the moment it's called, with no
 * locking against another run's concurrent appendRunLog() -- the old code just paid
 * for that same imprecision on every single line instead of once per MiB. This
 * concurrency trade-off is entirely orthogonal to the F5 environment-scoping fix
 * above: it was true before F5 (within the single shared directory) and remains true
 * after F5 (within one environment's own directory) -- F5 changes WHICH directory is
 * measured, not how fresh that measurement is.
