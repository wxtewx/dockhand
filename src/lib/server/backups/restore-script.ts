 * backups/restore-script.ts — pure builders for the restore helper-container

 *
 *   new-location: restic restores the requested volumes into a fresh target
 *                 directory. Non-destructive — nothing live is touched.
 *
 *   in-place:     restic restores each volume into a staging dir on the live
 *                 volume's own filesystem, then the phase-marked swap commits it
 *                 (see ./swap). The one destructive mode, made safe by staging.
 *
 * The restic restore for in-place must land each `/volumes/<name>` include under
 * `<live>/.dockhand-restore-new`, which happens by pointing `--target` at the
 * live volume root and letting restic recreate the `/volumes/<name>` path there.

 * restored, already validated as safe paths.
 *
 * We run one restic per volume so each lands in its own staging dir. restic's
 * `--target <live>` plus `--include /volumes/<name>` writes to
 * `<live>/volumes/<name>`, so we first restore to a scratch target then move the
 * restored subtree into `.dockhand-restore-new` — but simpler and equivalent:
 * restore with `--target <live>/.dockhand-restore-new` and strip the leading
 * `/volumes/<name>` via restic's path handling. To keep the shell simple and
