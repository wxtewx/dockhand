/**
 * backups/security.ts — the security surface for the backup/restore rewrite.
 *
 * These are the hardened, well-tested primitives that keep restic invocation,
 * credential handling, and restore targets safe (env/flag/cloud allowlists,
 * SSRF guards, at-rest encryption, path containment). We RE-EXPORT them from
 * their existing homes rather than re-deriving them: re-implementing a security
 * allowlist from scratch is exactly where a rewrite reintroduces the bug the
 * allowlist exists to prevent. One import site for the whole domain, so a
 * reviewer sees the security surface in one place.
 *
 * Nothing here has app-specific logic — it is a barrel plus two small pure guards
 * the rewrite needs (restore-target containment + a snapshot-path allowlist).
