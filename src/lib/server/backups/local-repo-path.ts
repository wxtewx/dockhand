/**
 * Pure validation for a LOCAL-path backup repository, shared by init/test (which run
 * restic in the Dockhand container) and the backup/restore helper (a sibling container
 * that bind-mounts the repo by its HOST path).
 *
 * The trap this guards (#1506): when Dockhand runs in a container, the "Path" field is
 * the path AS THE DOCKHAND CONTAINER SEES IT. If the user types the HOST path instead
 * (e.g. /opt/backups) while Dockhand only has it bind-mounted at /app/local-backups,
 * `restic init` writes the repo into the container's own ephemeral filesystem (it
 * vanishes on restart) and the helper - which mounts the host path - later finds an
 * empty dir. Both sides "work" in isolation but never agree on one location.
 *
 * A local repo is only usable when its container path is UNDER one of Dockhand's bind
 * mounts, so the same bytes are reachable from the host (where the helper mounts them).
 *
 * No I/O here: callers pass the cached mount table so this stays unit-testable.
