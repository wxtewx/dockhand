/**
 * Guard for the filesystem-browser endpoints (`/api/system/files*`).
 *
 * The file browser lets stacks:edit users browse the host to find/adopt/relocate
 * stacks, but no caller may read host or Dockhand secrets through it, so the
 * following are always blocked regardless of permission:
 *   - the database directory ($DATA_DIR/db, contains dockhand.db)
 *   - the encryption key file ($DATA_DIR/.encryption_key)
 *   - /proc - /proc/<pid>/environ exposes process env vars, including
 *     DATABASE_URL (Postgres credentials) and ENCRYPTION_KEY. The whole tree is
 *     blocked because /proc/self, /proc/1, etc. all leak the same secrets and
 *     nothing legitimate is browsed there.
 *   - /etc, /root - system account/secret files (/etc/shadow, /etc/passwd, root's
 *     home). Nothing a compose file lives in.
 *   - any path segment named .ssh (private keys / known_hosts) or .git (its
 *     config embeds remote credentials), at any depth. This blocks the credential
 *     files inside a git-repos clone while still letting the working copies be
 *     browsed (deploy verification, adoption).
 *
 * isProtectedPath resolves symlinks (via the nearest existing ancestor) so a
 * symlink pointing into a protected location can't be used to bypass the check.
