 * composition -- no fetch, no store, no formatting that depends on user settings
 * (relative/exact timestamps stay in the component, which already has
 * formatRelativeTime/formatDateTime available for that).
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free (mirrors deploy-summary-core.ts / run-status.ts):
 * no import from $lib/server (better-sqlite3 isn't importable under Bun, and would
 * drag down every other test file sharing this process) and no import from
 * $lib/stores or $app -- those need a mounted Svelte/SvelteKit runtime this test
 * file doesn't have. The shapes below intentionally mirror (not import)
 * deploy-run-record-core.ts / deploy-summary-core.ts on the server: client code
 * never imports $lib/server, even for types (see StackModal.svelte's own local
 * BackupConfig for the same pattern).
