 * actually carry secrets that survived redaction -- so it MUST NOT come out
 * looking safe just because a file path happened to be unresolvable. Every
 * check below runs BEFORE the file is ever touched: authentication, then
 * stacks:view, then ownership+environment access via loadOwnedDeployRun (the
 * exact same helper GET/DELETE .../deploys/{runId} use, so this route can
 * never drift into trusting a run it shouldn't). Only once all of that has
 * passed does readRunLog() run at all.

/**
 * @openapi
 * summary: Get a deploy run's log text (text/plain, from the on-disk file)
 * description: 400 ("Invalid run id") is produced by the shared loadOwnedDeployRun() helper (deploy-run-access.ts), not literally in this handler's body -- the openapi generator's static scanner cannot see status()/error() calls in a different file, hence the prose here instead of a resp-400 line (same pattern as POST /api/backup/destinations/{id}/task's description). The 404 below covers BOTH loadOwnedDeployRun's "run not found / belongs to a different stack" AND this handler's own "log file missing" -- the latter IS literal in this file's body, which is why it can stay a resp-404 line.
 * path: name:string! Stack name (from GET /api/stacks)
 * path: runId:integer! Run id (from GET /api/stacks/{name}/deploys)
 * resp-200: Plain-text log content
 * resp-401: Authentication required
 * resp-403: Permission denied (needs stacks:view for the run's own environment), or access denied to this environment
 * resp-404: Deploy run not found (also returned for a run that belongs to a different stack), or log file missing
